### Problem Statement 5:

A series of client machines [1, 2, … n] are located along a linear network. The i-th client generates the amount of traffic that is given by w[i]. You want to place k servers along the linear network that minimizes the total amount of traffic carried by the network. Total traffic is given by the sum of each client’s individual traffic, multiplied by the distance (the number of hops) from the server. Provide a polynomial time algorithm to identify the optimal locations for k servers.
